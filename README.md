## About Me ðŸŽ‰
I'm a software developer who's all about backend technologies, rocking in Docker and Docker Compose for crafting containerized apps. Django's my jam for building robust and high-performance apps. Got a knack for developing APIs with FastAPI and an ever-growing love affair with frontend - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you have my heart.

*On a quest for learning and growing in the tech world, seizing every chance to level up my skills and sprinkle some magic in innovative projects! ðŸŒŸ*

P.S.: By the way, I use NeoVim... because why just code, when you can do it with style? ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥
